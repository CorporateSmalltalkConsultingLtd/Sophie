# Sophie
Sophie, a book publishing system.

Sophie had two apps, one the authoring tool, then one built from the authoring tool as a reader.
Sophie books came in two forms:
*.spbf the form that can be altered by the authoring tool.
*.sophie the read-only version that is published by reading by the Sophie Reader.

The Sophie app is an executable folder/app that should run on OSX/MACOS mavericks, some version of windows, and some version of Linux.  As we restart the Sophie project we will look towards building new versions of the apps on current operating systems to support 64 bit systems.
